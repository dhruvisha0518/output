# 📈 Relative Strength (RS) Value Automation

This project enhances the **RS value output** originally used in the [MarketSmith Indicator by Fred6724](https://github.com/Fred6725/relative-strength).  

A few months ago, I noticed the RS rating wasn’t always consistent. That inspired me to build an **automation system that processes 8,500+ stock tickers in under 30 minutes**, calculating daily RS values benchmarked against SPY.  

The goal is to provide traders with a **fast, consistent, and open alternative** to expensive subscription services.
